# Radioactive Wasteland

After generating a world, run two commands:<br>
	/nc_set_chunk_radius_radiation 10 50<br>
	/nc_set_chunk_radius_radiation 0 3<br>
Note that the first command might lag for a while, this is ok and intended, just wait for it to complete. These commands will irradiate everything in a 50 chunk radius except for a 7x7 square at your spawn, which players will be able to move in freely
