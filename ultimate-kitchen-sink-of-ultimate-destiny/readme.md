# Ultimate Kitchen Sink of Ultimate Destiny

i noticed that some mods, like Create or Hex Casting, just have way too many addons. I wondered how bad/good a pack would be that has a few "pillar" mods and then a ridiculous amount of addons for each

no care has been taken for balance but knowing myself i will probably obsess over the balance at some point

this is my first actually decently sized kitchen-sink
