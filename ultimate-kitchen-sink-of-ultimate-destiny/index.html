<h1>Ultimate Kitchen Sink of Ultimate Destiny</h1>

<p>i noticed that some mods, like Create or Hex Casting, just have way too many addons. I wondered how bad/good a pack would be that has a few &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; mods and then a ridiculous amount of addons for each</p>

<p>no care has been taken for balance but knowing myself i will probably obsess over the balance at some point</p>

<p>this is my first actually decently sized kitchen-sink</p>
