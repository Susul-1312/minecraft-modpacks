This repo exists so you can easily download my modpacks using [packwiz-installer](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/)

Feel free to do that, just replace `[your server]` with `susul-1312.github.io/minecraft-modpacks/[modpack name]` (e.g. `susul-1312.github.io/minecraft-modpacks/war-games/`)

You can also naviage to `Actions` and download the artifact of the latest action called `packs.zip`, which contains files that you can import into MultiMC or Prism.
